#### Word Prediction 

This Shiny App is for predicting text.  The data is courtesy <http://www.swiftkey.com> and uses a sample of the English language blog, twitter, and news data sets.  The <code>quatenda</code> package is used to clean the data and create a corpus.  Several n-gram **data.table** are created, then back-off smooth scores are added to the data.tables to help with speed. 

To use the Prediction tab, use the slider to predict the number of text predictors.  Then type in any text and hit the <b>Predict</b> button, or simply press Enter.

Future updates to do:
- Better modelling algorithms
- More computing space to create larger document matrixes
